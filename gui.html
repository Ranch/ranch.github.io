		<p>Our Gui project is Tic Tac Toe. There’s two icons, the crosses and the circles, the game is played normally just like any other game of TTT. There’s an indicator at the bottom of the Gui that tells you who’s turn it is and once the match is finished, based on the results it’ll tell you who won or if the game was a draw. Here I have 3 screen shots of what all of the possible end results are, X wins, O Win, and Draw.</p>
		<p1>I had a lot of issues with this program, I didn’t know how to create to graphics for the crosses and noughts so I had to look into some sources that brought up that the empty cells had to be accounted for and not count for anything. I had to rewrite the part where wins would be counted and created a function where it would update and check if there was any empty cell, if that was the case, the game would continue until all 9 cells were full or until a player won the game. This brought up another issue, I didn’t know how I was going to implement a system for winning, I made a logging system where it kept track of what cells were filled in and if it followed a certain sequence without interruptions, for example, [xxx] or [ooo], the game would count that as a win instead of, [xox] or [oxo]. That was my issue, no matter what the game would count any sequence as a win like [oxo], even though we obviously know that’s not a win.
